# Logic_Building_Assignments

# Logic Building Assignments in C

This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate logic building programs written in C. These are designed to strengthen fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and input/output operations.

#Contents

Each program in this repository is focused on building a specific logical skill. Common topics include:

- Basic input/output
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and modular code
- Number theory (prime numbers, factorial, etc.)

# Objective

To help:
- Practice writing clean and structured code
- Learn how to break problems into smaller functions
- Understand edge cases and input validation
- Improve problem-solving skills

# How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
